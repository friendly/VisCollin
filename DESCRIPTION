Description: Provides methods to calculate diagnostics for multicollinearity among predictors in a linear or
  generalized linear model. Also provides methods to visualize those diagnostics following Friendly & Kwan (2009),
  "Where’s Waldo: Visualizing Collinearity Diagnostics", The American Statistician, 63, 56–65.
  These include a semi-graphic tableplot of the diagnostics and a collinearity biplot of the smallest dimensions
  of predictor space, where collinearity is most apparent.

Description: Provides methods to calculate diagnostics for multicollinearity among predictors in a linear or
  generalized linear model. It also provides methods to visualize those diagnostics following Friendly & Kwan (2009),
  "Whereâ€™s Waldo: Visualizing Collinearity Diagnostics", <doi:10.1198/tast.2009.0012>.
  These include better tabular presentation of collinearity diagnostics that highlight the important numbers,
  a semi-graphic tableplot of the diagnostics to make warning and danger levels more salient,
  and a "collinearity biplot" of the smallest dimensions of predictor space, where collinearity is most apparent.

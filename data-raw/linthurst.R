#' title: Linthurst biomass data
#' ---

# Data from: Rawlings et-al. Applied Regression Analysis, 2nd Ed., Table 5.1

# The data considered are part of a larger study conducted by Dr. Rick
# Linthurst (1979) at North Carolina State University as his Ph.D. thesis
# research. The purpose of his research was to identify the important soil
# characteristics influencing aerial biomass production of the marsh grass
# Spartina alterniflora in the Cape Fear Estuary of North Carolina.
# One phase of Linthurstâ€™s research consisted of sampling three types of

# Aerial biomass (BIO) and five physicochemical properties of the sub-
#   strate (salinity (SAL), pH, K, Na, and Zn) in the Cape Fear Estuary of North
# Carolina. (Data used with permission of Dr. R. A. Linthurst.)

# read the data, slightly awkward in R because there are 2 lines/case
